4) How do you get a thread's name?

5) What does the "synchronize()" method do?
    Synchronizes two threads; so one can't run before another.

    joins two threads together.

7) What does the "sleep()" method do?
    makes the thread wait for x amount of time (milliseconds)

8) What is the one method you must write if you're implementing the Runnable class?
    you must override the thread object/variable in the Runnable class; implement the variables first.

9) Should you create that same method if you're extending Thread?
    No, because it extends Thread Superclass it already has access to it's variables and methods.
