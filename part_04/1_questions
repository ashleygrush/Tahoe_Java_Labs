Answer the following questions:

1) What is an array?
    an array is a group of organized variables.

2) What the code required to create (instantiate) a String array with size 10 named "cats"?
    String <cats>[] = String [10];

3) What is a multidimensional array?
    a two-dimensional array.

4) What is the code required to create (instantiate) a 2-dimensional int array that is 6 high and 6 wide named "scores"?
    int scores[] = int [6][6];

5) Using code, how do you retrieve a String that is the 10th item in a traditional array named dogs?
    if (String i = 0, i < dogs.length; i++);
    String i = dogs[9];
    sout(i);

6) What is an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException?
    it means the array has exceeded it's length (ie 6 < 5).

7) Using one line of code, demonstrate how to retrieve the second to the last item from a int array.
    if (int i = array.length, i > 0, i--);

8) What is the maximum allowable size of an array in Java?
    no limit

9) What is a bubble sort?
    rearranges the array variables from smallest/largest or largest/smallest.

10) How does a bubble sort work?
    it works from one side to another, compairing indexes and shifting the order with every
    pass until there is no more shifting.

11) When might you use an irregular array? What is a good example of an irregular array?
    and irregular array

12) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a for loop.
    for (int i = 0, i < array.length; i++) {
        sout("array[i]" + " | ");
        }

13) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a while loop.
    do (i = 0){
    i++;
    sout("array[i]" + " | ");
    }
    while (i < array.length);

14) What is a queue?
    a queue is first in, first out; using two variables.

15) What are the two primary operations that a queue performs?
    allocating variables to memory

16) What is a stack?
    like a queue, first in, last out; uses only one variable.

17) What differentiates stacks and queues?
     see above.

18) When would you use an enhanced for loop?
    to display/fill an array.

19) What is "The Collections Framework"? What classes does it include?
    A collections framework is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections,
     enabling collections to be manipulated independently of implementation details.
     It contains mostly interface classes.


20) How do you iterate over a two-dimensional array? Demonstrate using psuedo code.
    You use a nested for loop.

    for (int i = 0, i < array.length, i++);
        for (int j = 0, i array[0].length, j++);
            sout("[i][j]")??

21) What is a String?
    sequence of characters in java... "a word"

22) What are a few common methods for operating on Strings?
    String.charAt() - finds a character
    String.length - length of a string
    String.substr - counts up/down the string

23) What does "Strings are immutable" mean?
    They cannot be changed.

24) Using the CLI, how do you invoke a Java application and provide two parameters to the main method?
    something with args??
