1) Describe the exception hierarchy.
        Throwable
 Error              Exception
      run-time exception

2) What is a try/catch statement?
    Try - works through the code; tried the code.
    Catch - catches and handles any exceptions.

3) Why do we use try/catch statements?
    To handle exceptions gracefully and in the moment.

4) Write a full example of a try/catch/finally statement that catches two distinct exceptions
    public int divide(int a, int b){
    Try{
        int c = a / b;
        return c;
    }
    catch (int a | int b = 0){
        sout("Can't divide by zero.");
    }
    catch (int a | int b < 0){
        sout("Please use positive numbers only."
        }
    }


5) What does it mean to "throw" an exception? How does it work?
    throwing an exception is throwing a custom exception and tries to handle it.

6) What happens if your application encounters an exception and you don't catch it or throw it?
    it will stop the program completely.

7) When catching exception in an inheritance hierarchy, should you catch the subclass exception or the
superclass exception first? Why?
    ??

8) Write a nested try/catch statement.
    Try (int a = 5){
        try (int a <= 4){
            sout("A is less than 5."
        sout("A is equal to 5."
     }
     catch (ArithmaticException ae){
        sout("AE caught").
     }
   }

9) What does it mean to rethrow an exception?
    it is rethrown into Exceptions to try and catch it again.

10) What are the 7 methods that come with the Throwable class?
    1) public Exception() { super(); }
    2) public Exception(String message) { super(message);}
    3) public Exception(String message, Throwable cause) { super(message, cause); }
    4) public Exception(Throwable cause) { super(cause); }
    5) protected Exception(String message, Throwable cause, boolean enableSuppression,
    boolean writableStackTrace) { super(message, cause, enableSuppression, writableStackTrace);


11) What does the "finally" block do?
    finally closes/executes regardless.

12) When is the finally block executed? Will it ever not be executed?
    at the very end. It will always execute.

13) What are the three recently added features to Java exceptions?
    ??
