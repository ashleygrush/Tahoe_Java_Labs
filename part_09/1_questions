1) What is the difference between a byte stream and a character stream?
    a byte stream is limited to 8 bytes or less.
    a character stream can use 16 or less and any character in the ASCII table.

2) List at least 3 examples of byte stream classes?
    inputStream()
    outputStream()
    FileInputStream()


3) List at least 3 examples of character stream classes?
    bufferReader()
    bufferWriter()
    FileReader()

4) What is try-with-resources? Why is it super cool?
    ensures that whatever file you're reading is closed/disconnected once finished.

5) Demonstrate a try-wth-resources block:
    try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(path))) {
        return br.readLine();
        }

6) What does the read() method on the FileInputStream class return?
    a byte of data.

7) What is the documentation above of the FileInputStream class header say? (hint: inside /** ... */)
         A FileInputStream obtains input bytes from a file in a file system.
         What files are available depends on the host environment.
            FileInputStream is meant for reading streams of raw bytes such as
            image data. For reading streams of characters, consider using FileReader.

8) Is a DataOutputStream used for bytes or characters?
    bytes.

9) What is a BufferedReader?
    Reads a file line by line.

10) Why does a BufferedReader require an InputStreamReader as an argument?
    because it encases the inputStreamReader (byte by byte).

11) What does the InputStreamReader do with it's byte stream argument?
    Reads the next byte of data from the input stream. The value byte is
    returned as an int in the range 0 to 255. If no byte is available because
    the end of the stream has been reached, the value 1 is returned. This
    method blocks until input data is available, the end of the stream is detected,
    or an exception is thrown.

12) What is the difference between the read() and readLine() on BufferedReader?
    read() - byte by byte.
    readLine() - line by line.
    BufferReader() - entire file.

13) Demonstrate instantiating a BufferedReader that will read a file called "yucatan_cenotes.txt"
    BufferedInputStream buffReader = new BufferedInputStream("yucatan_cenotes.txt");
